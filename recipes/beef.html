    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Pho recipe has been in the works for a while now. It’s been quietly made and remade by various RecipeTin family members since our first trip to Vietnam. We’ve compared notes, debated furiously about how the latest iteration compared to the (many) bowls of Pho soup we slurped during our travels, and our favourite Pho restaurants back home here in Sydney.</p>
    <ul>Ingredient
        <li>water</li>
        <li>rinse</li>
        <li>bones</li>
        <li>noodle</li>
        <li>onion</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>Quick boil – Remove impurities from beef with a 5 minute boil, it’s the path to a beautiful clear soup;</li>
            <li>Scum – be amazed at all the icky stuff that comes out;</li>
            <li>Wash the bones to get all the icky scum off;</li>
            <li>Simmer for 3 hours – bones, beef, water, onion, ginger and spices (cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, star anise);</li>
            <li>Remove brisket  – some is used for Pho topping, see below recipe for ways to use remainder;</li>
            <li>Simmer 40 minutes further with just bones;</li>
            <li>Strain; then</li>
            <li>Ladle into bowls over noodles and pile on Toppings!</li>
    </ol>
